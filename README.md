# HybridImages

Hybrid Images are an optical illusion where a single image can be perceived in two ways depending on the viewing distance.

# Installation

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install the dependencies using ```requirements.txt```
3. Launch ```main.py``` from the root of the depository
4. Have fun with it, add more images in ```data/``` using the numbering accordingly (1a, 1b, etc.).
